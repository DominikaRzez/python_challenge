The python_challenge repository includes 2 folders: PyBank and PyPoll.


PyBank folder contains folder 'Resources' with the budget_data.csv that was used for this analysis. The main.py file conatines the script that was written in Jupyter Notebook. The Python script analyses the total number of the months included in the budget_data dataset, the total amount of profits and losses over the entire period. The code also calculates the change in profit/losses over the entire period and returns the average of those changes for 86 months. In the file you can also find script to find the greatest increase and decrease in profits/losses and the date when this occured. At the end the final script prints the completed analysis to the terminal and exports the text file to the Analysis folder (also included in the PyBank folder)

The PyPoll folder also includes 'Rescources' folder with the data set used for this analysis - election_data.csv. The Python script in the main.py file calculates the total number of votes, returns a complete list of candidates, the total number and percentage of votes each of those candidates won and the winner of the election. This code also prints the final analysis to the terminal and exports the text file with the result and stores it in the Analysis folder.
